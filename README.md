My family restaurant didn't have a webPage so I created one. 

# Details
*  This webPage is only one page. I didn't know what else to add.  
*  The webPage is super simple that I created using HTML, CSS, Javasript.  
*  The webPage receive about 12-16 viewers everyday (check using google analytics).  
*  It display all the basic info at the top and it showcase the Menu.  
*  This webPage scale so it work both on desktop and mobile.  

# ERROR
*  I tried, but failed, many time to make the info at the top to position itself automatically to be in the middle depending on 
the size of the page. Therefore, the info at the top doesn't position itself to be in the middle and sometime it will look unalign.

# LEARN
*  I was able to learn more about the the basic of HTML, CSS, Javascript. This project heavily focus on layout and design so 
I was able play and learn very much about CSS.
